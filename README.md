# ðŸ§  Chronic Disease Prediction

A machine learning classification project to predict the likelihood of chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease) based on patient data.

## ðŸ“š Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning algorithms to medical data to classify whether a patient is likely to suffer from a chronic illness.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Source: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease/)
- Size: 10,000+ records with features like blood pressure, BMI, glucose levels, etc.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, normalization)
- Model training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC

## ðŸ’» Technologies
- Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Best Model: Random Forest  
- Accuracy: 95%  
- ROC-AUC Score: 0.98
